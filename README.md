# EnSampleRequest

### Purpose: This repository will serve as a common point to all the other public repositories on Enpassio where a request can be made to do a sample on particular android or related topic

#### Why different repository for sample request:
While there are a number of project repositories and each of them have separate **issues** section, where one can make a request for new sample around the main topic covered in that repository, we'll still have a single entry point for sample request. The reason is that, the issues section can also be used to report a bug or suggest improvements so it can be hard to guess which *issue* is actually a sample request and which one is of the other kinds as mentioned previously.

#### *How to make a sample request*

The best and efficient way to avoid any repetition of already made request is that, you should first check if there is already a sample available on the topic you want a sample on. This can be checked at the [README file](https://github.com/enpassio/SampleList/blob/master/README.md) of the repository [SampleList](https://github.com/enpassio/SampleList) which lists all the samples available on Enpassio, both in development state and finished and then check if the issue already exist in the **issue** section of this repository at [this link](https://github.com/enpassio/EnSampleRequest/issues) which means that the work might be already under progress on the same. If it's still not there or have been closed previously without being considered, please make a new **issue** and explain in brief how that can help the community or why it should be reconsidered. We've limited resources and the team members are working on it taking out time from their jobs and personal time, just to help the community and so we should try to make the best use of their time.

#### Ways to track the issue:
Once you've made a sample request, team Enpassio will take a look into it and will discuss the same with you, if required to clarify the requirements or the features/concepts needed to be covered in the sample. And once it's finalized, the *issue will be **assigned** to one of the member of **Enpassio***. Otherwise, it'll be closed if the work has been completed or not considered further.

#### Further notes and ways to connect:
If you've any idea which is beyond just sample request or any suggestions for us, please feel free to communicate with us on the **issue thread** at [this link](https://github.com/enpassio/EnSampleRequest/issues/1) or at **admin@enpassio.com**.
